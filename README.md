The motivation behind this project is to create a simpler to understand visualization of covid-19. Initially I was hoping to create a map that's easier to interpret than the John Hopkins' one. Now, the scope broadened to include more information in an easier-to-analyze manner.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
